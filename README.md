## Working with authentication and tokens  

Here I worked with Django Rest Framework, especially tried adding api of authentication.

Also i worked with permissions

I used serializers to convert data

### What`s that about
We can make posts, only admin can see all of them, authenticated users can see their posts

And we can get tokens
